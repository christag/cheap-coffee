# Starbucks drinks in September 2025: recipes, customizations, and complete specifications

The Starbucks menu for September 2025 features the return of fall favorites alongside significant menu innovations, most notably the complete elimination of non-dairy milk upcharges since November 2024. The current fall lineup launched August 26 includes the Pumpkin Spice Latte, a brand-new Pecan Oatmilk Cortado with brown butter notes, Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, and notably excludes Apple Crisp drinks this year. Starbucks operates on a standardized recipe system where hot drinks follow a 2/3/4/5 pump pattern for short through venti sizes, while iced drinks use 3/4/6/7 pumps to compensate for ice dilution. This comprehensive research reveals exact build specifications, over 170,000 possible drink combinations through free customizations, and the precise recipes that baristas use to craft each beverage.

## Fall 2025 menu features pecan and pumpkin, no apple crisp

The current seasonal menu centers around two flavor profiles: pumpkin and pecan. The **Pumpkin Spice Latte** returns with its standard recipe of 3/4/5 pumps pumpkin sauce for tall/grande/venti hot drinks, while the new **Pecan Oatmilk Cortado** introduces a sophisticated 8-ounce beverage with three ristretto shots of Blonde Espresso, pecan syrup, brown butter notes, and steamed oatmilk topped with pecan crunch. The **Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew** layers slow-steeped cold brew with vanilla syrup (2/3/4 pumps) and real pumpkin cream cold foam, while the **Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai** offers a coffee-free alternative with chai concentrate topped with the same pumpkin foam.

January 2025 marked the permanent addition of Cortado varieties to the core menu, including the standard Cortado and Brown Sugar Oatmilk Cortado, both served exclusively in 8-ounce cups with three ristretto shots. The **official Secret Menu** launched July 14, 2025, now appears in the Starbucks app's "offers" tab for Rewards members, featuring drinks like "Cookies on Top" (Cold Brew with vanilla syrup, vanilla sweet cream cold foam, and cookie crumble topping) and "Just Add White Mocha" (Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso enhanced with white chocolate mocha sauce).

Starbucks continues its menu simplification initiative, planning to reduce offerings by **30%** by the end of fiscal 2025. This strategic reduction explains the absence of Apple Crisp drinks and the discontinuation of 13 beverages in March 2025, including Iced Matcha Lemonade and several Frappuccino varieties.

## Standard recipes follow precise pump and shot patterns

Barista training materials reveal the exact specifications for every drink size. Hot beverages receive **2/3/4/5 pumps** of syrup for short (8oz), tall (12oz), grande (16oz), and venti (20oz) respectively, paired with **1/1/2/2 espresso shots**. Iced drinks follow a different pattern with **3/4/6/7 pumps** for tall through trenta (30oz) sizes and **1/2/3 shots** for tall through venti iced. The distinction exists because venti iced cups hold 24 ounces versus 20 ounces for venti hot, requiring additional syrup and espresso to maintain flavor balance against ice dilution.

The pump systems themselves differ significantly: hot bar pumps dispense **½ ounce** (1 tablespoon) per pump, while cold bar pumps deliver **¼ ounce** (½ tablespoon). Brown sugar syrup uses special half-dose pumps, effectively halving the sweetness compared to standard syrups. Mocha and white mocha sauces use the same ½-ounce pumps as hot bar syrups.

The standard build sequence for hot espresso drinks follows: steam milk, add syrup to cup, pull espresso shots, add steamed milk, top with foam, finish with any drizzles. Iced drinks build differently: syrup first, then milk to the specified line, ice, espresso shots on top, stir well, then add toppings. Frappuccinos require a more complex process with coffee base (2/3/4 pumps), milk to the bottom line, flavor syrups, frappuccino base, appropriate ice scoop, blend, then top with whipped cream.

## Free milk alternatives revolutionized customization economics

The November 7, 2024 policy change eliminated all non-dairy milk upcharges, saving customers up to $0.80 per drink and making **oat, almond, soy, and coconut milk** substitutions completely free alongside traditional dairy options (2%, whole, nonfat, heavy cream, half-and-half). This change, combined with existing free customizations, creates unprecedented flexibility for personalizing drinks without additional cost.

Temperature adjustments range from **kids temperature** at 130°F through standard 150-170°F to **extra hot** at 180°F, all available at no charge. Foam modifications include no foam, light foam, and extra foam options, while ice levels can be adjusted from none to extra without cost. Free powder toppings include **cinnamon, cocoa powder, and vanilla powder**, though nutmeg was recently discontinued due to low demand.

The 2025 syrup policy allows free substitutions within pre-flavored beverages—customers can swap vanilla for caramel in a Caramel Macchiato or add white mocha to a Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso without charge. Unflavored beverages incur an $0.80 charge for adding syrups, but multiple syrups count as a single modifier. Sweetness adjustments through pump modifications (half-sweet, quarter-sweet, or extra pumps) remain free, as do alternative sweeteners like Stevia, Equal, and honey.

## Shaken espressos pack extra caffeine with unique preparation

Shaken espresso drinks contain **one additional shot** compared to standard iced beverages—grande shaken espressos get 3 shots versus 2 in regular iced lattes, while venti versions pack 4 shots. The preparation method creates the signature texture: hot espresso pours over ice in a cocktail shaker with syrup, then baristas shake vigorously for **10-20 seconds** until frothy. This aeration creates micro-bubbles that soften coffee intensity while rapidly chilling the espresso completely.

The current shaken espresso lineup includes the Classic Iced Shaken Espresso (with 4 pumps classic syrup for grande), **Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk** (using half-dose brown sugar pumps with cinnamon topping), **Iced Chocolate Almondmilk** (featuring chocolate malt powder), **Iced Toasted Vanilla Oatmilk** (with vanilla bean syrup), and the new **Iced Horchata Oatmilk** launched May 2025 with cinnamon-vanilla-nutty notes. Each variety finishes with just a splash of milk—approximately **¼ cup**—maintaining the coffee-forward profile that distinguishes shaken espressos from traditional lattes.

## Refreshers and energy drinks target afternoon customers

Starbucks Refreshers contain **45mg of caffeine** per grande size from green coffee extract, significantly less than espresso drinks but enough to provide an afternoon boost. The base concentrate combines with water, lemonade, or coconut milk, plus **1-2 scoops** of freeze-dried fruit inclusions depending on size. Current flavors include Strawberry Açaí, Mango Dragonfruit, Pineapple Passionfruit, and the new Summer-Berry Refresher introduced in 2025 with raspberry-flavored popping pearls.

The Iced Energy platform launched in 2024 offers sugar-free options with **140-205mg caffeine** per venti size. In-store versions include Tropical Citrus (passionfruit and citrus with green tea) and Melon Burst (melon and cucumber with Passion Tango tea), both containing just 5 calories. Ready-to-drink versions released March 2025 provide **160mg plant-based caffeine** per 12-ounce can in Tropical Peach, Watermelon Twist, and Blueberry Lemonade flavors at $2.99 suggested retail.

## Size scaling includes important exceptions to standard rules

While most drinks follow predictable scaling patterns, several beverages break these rules for specific reasons. The **Flat White** exclusively uses ristretto shots and receives one additional shot compared to standard drinks—tall gets 2 shots, grande and venti hot get 3, while venti iced receives 4. **Americanos** scale even higher with 2/3/4/5 shots for tall through venti iced to balance espresso strength against added hot water.

**Caramel Macchiatos** receive one less pump of vanilla syrup than standard, compensated by the caramel drizzle on top. All **Frappuccinos** get just 1 espresso shot regardless of size, relying instead on coffee base for caffeine content. The **Iced Shaken Espresso** variations consistently include extra shots as their defining characteristic.

Trenta size (30oz) remains available only for non-espresso beverages: iced coffee, cold brew, iced teas, lemonades, and Refreshers. The size difference between venti hot (20oz) and venti iced (24oz) accounts for ice volume, with iced versions receiving proportionally more syrup and espresso to maintain flavor intensity as ice melts.
